###### *Trivia game about animals* 

### Description
Anivia is a simple trivia game developed to provide and boost educational knowledge about animals for children below 10 years old. Through using descriptive hints to describe the animal, they will be able to guess the animal that fits the given descriptions. This game helps to improve their ability to link ideas with similar concepts together. In this scenario, the players will have to link different hints that describes the same animal together.

### Gameplay
Players will start off the game with 3 lives. Then, they will be given description about a certain animal per question, and they will be prompted to input their answer. They have 3 attempts per question, which they can use all 3 attempts without losing any life. Different hints will be provided with each attempt. After all 3 hints are used up and the player still does not answer correctly, they will lose one life and the animal trivia continues until all the questions have been answered or the player have no more life. The challenge added to the game for the game to be more engaging is the time limit for each question. Once the time limit of 20 seconds is reached and the players are still unable to get the correct answer, the players remaining attempts will be scrapped and they will lose a life while proceeding to the next question.   

### Installation
Environment with python will required for the code execution. Current version of python tested is version 3.10. Click on the link below to download Python.  
[Installation of python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

For the python libraries, Anivia is developed with Python Standard Libraries. Python Standard Libraries usually comes together with Python installation, thus no extra steps will be required. (If there is error with missing libraries, you can try pip install the missing libraries.)


### Usage
To run the game, execute main.py file. It will run the game and calls the other python files in this project automatically. Ensure that the files are all in the same directory before running the file.  

To edit any parts of the game regarding gameplay, the codes are mainly located in classes.py file. For turtle design and animation-wise, the codes are in Win.py file.

You can use Python IDLE to run the main.py file, or any IDE of your choice that supports Python.

### Support
You could just call 999 should you run into errors because the developers are busy with school.  

Just kidding, please contact Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) if you have any queries.

### Roadmap
Even though the game is developed, there is room for improvement. Integrating database with Anivia will be benificial as it is efficient for data storage and data retrieval, and it will be useful as the game scales up. The players will be able to store their data such as their performance for them to review.
